There is nothing much to do when it comes to the prevntiions to this but regardless of that the people around the globe
fail to take such simple steps to win the war against this pandemic.
So can you contribute by following such simple steps lets find out:-
1. First and the foremost things STAY AT YOUR HOME OR WHERE IN THE WORLD YOU ARE LIVING CURRENTLY, do not travel long
distances.
2. If you failed to do the above step and travelled a long distance then what you must do is self isolation for a minimum
of 14 days and  if you get symptons(mentioned above) then immediately contact the declared authorities in your region.
3. Even if you are in your house it is important that you maintain social distancing within your house as well i.e. 
maintain 2 meteres recommended distance from the other person because the symptons of this are very general and sometimes
they are not visible as well.
4. When you are sneezing or coughing it is important that you use a tissue paper or if you dont have one use your hands 
properly and DO NOT TOUCH anything else and wash your hands properly with a recommended hand soap.
5. If you cannot do anything of the above atleast carry a mask with you.
Some more guidelines:-
6. In this lockdown scenarios people often get panicked and start buying rations in bulk which is not appropriate and 
should not happen, so please refrain from panic buying.
7. Always be uptodate with your government's schemes on the scenarios and the helpline numbers.
8. Do not believe on the whatsapp forwards and other social media fake news because these often become the reason of panic
among the people so stay intelligent and take decisions wisely.
9. There are still many who dont yet understand the severity of the situation so tell about the current scenarios to as 
many people as possible.
10. If you are a capable individual you should also contribute to the funds of your government and try to provide rations 
to the needfuls in your locality.
