				<div id="CoronaViruses" class="sections"><h3>CoronaViruses</h3><p id="coronavirusesp">CoronaViruses are a family of viruses discovered in the 20th century, this can cause respirtory targeted diseases like
				common cold and even lethal diseases like SARS, MERS and the present pandemic Covid19(It is to be noted that Covid19 is a CoronaVirus but every coronavirus isnt Covid19). It is also important to know that a vaccine for the same is yet to be developed.
				Now ill talk about Covid19 it is also commonly reffered to as Novel Coronavirus. It was first discovered first in December 
				2019 in Wuhan, China(thus the reference of 19 in its name) and thereafter it has been spreading rapidly causing this PANDEMIC.
				MORE ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC IN THE NEXT SECTION </p>
				<img id="coronaviruses1" src="images/coronaviruses1.jpg" alt=""></div>


				
				<div id="current_state" class="sections"><h3>Covid-19</h3><p id="currentstatep">This virus spreads through close contact and through small droplets that are produced while coughing, sneezing or talking
				and that's why the world is shouting about "Social Distancing", it is generally not an airborne virus, but it can also 
				spread through touching of surfaces contaminated with this and that's why the world is shouting about "Proper Hand Washing
				every now and then" also note that this survive onto surfaces upto 72hrs and this data can be used into preventive
				strategies explained in the later section.
				Upon catching the virus its symptons can take 2-14 days to appear and that's why it is important to quarantine/isolate
				yourself for a minimal of 14 days if you have came from travelling long distances(which you shouldn't do at any cost).
				Its Symptons include <strong>high fevers, cough, shortness of breath</strong>, pain, sore throat and even loss of smell.
				As told in the earlier section it is important to know that there is no vaccine for it developed yet so "Prevention is the
				only cure".
				& THESE PREVENTIONS ARE EXPLAINED IN THE NEXT SECTION</p>

				<div id="how_to_stay_safe" class="sections"><h3>How to stay safe</h3><p id="howtostaysafep">There is nothing much to do when it comes to the prevntiions to this but regardless of that the people around the globe
				fail to take such simple steps to win the war against this pandemic. <br>
				So can you contribute by following such simple steps lets find out:- <br>
				1. First and the foremost things STAY AT YOUR HOME OR WHERE IN THE WORLD YOU ARE LIVING CURRENTLY, do not travel long
				<br>
				2. If you failed to do the above step and travelled a long distance then what you must do is self isolation for a minimum
				of 14 days and  if you get symptons(mentioned above) then immediately contact the declared authorities in your region. <br>
				3. Even if you are in your house it is important that you maintain social distancing within your house as well i.e. 
				maintain 2 meteres recommended distance from the other person because the symptons of this are very general and sometimes
				they are not visible as well. <br>
				4. When you are sneezing or coughing it is important that you use a tissue paper or if you dont have one use your hands 
				properly and DO NOT TOUCH anything else and wash your hands properly with a recommended hand soap. <br>
				5. If you cannot do anything of the above atleast carry a mask with you. <br>
				Some more guidelines:- <br>
				6. In this lockdown scenarios people often get panicked and start buying rations in bulk which is not appropriate and 
				should not happen, so please refrain from panic buying.<br>
				7. Always be uptodate with your government's schemes on the scenarios and the helpline numbers.<br>
				8. Do not believe on the whatsapp forwards and other social media fake news because these often become the reason of panic
				among the people so stay intelligent and take decisions wisely.<br>
				9. There are still many who dont yet understand the severity of the situation so tell about the current scenarios to as 
				many people as possible.<br>
				10. If you are a capable individual you should also contribute to the funds of your government and try to provide rations 
				to the needfuls in your locality.<br></p>
